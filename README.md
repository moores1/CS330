# CS330 C++ Programming Project
This repo is for my CS 330 project

## Assignment 1:

### History and Use
I have chosen to research and learn about C++. The language was created in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup in an effort to make a language that could help programmers make more sophisticated systems while maintaining low-level access to hardware. However, the first edition of C++ wasn't actually published until 1985. 

C++ is often used in the gaming, finance, computing, and robotics industries since it is a low-latency language. 

In game development, C++ is advantageous since it has a high performace compared to other languages. Most APIs are written in C++ to keep runtime as low as possible. Within the finance indutry, C++ is used within market making strategies in option trading since it is crucial to have low-latency programming so your data can be updated quickly and you won't be taken advantage of by a faster firm. Robotics also uses C++ as it has direct access to hardware so you can write code for sensors and other components. 

### Coding with C++

In order to code in C++, you first need to download the extension for C++ on VisualStudio Code. If you have't installed it before, you will also need a compiler since VS Code doesn't have one. You can go to this [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp), and install the version that is compatabile with your operating system. There is an example on the site to download the necessary software for each specific OS as well as how to construct a hello world program!

VS Code is not the only IDE that supports C++, but I chose to use it since I already had it downloaded, and I use it the most frequently for coding in other languages. Compared to programs like Python or Java, C++ runs the same way in VS Code. All you have to do is press the play button or the F5/Crtl+F5 keyboard shortcut. 
To comment in C++, all you have to do it `//` for a single line comment, or open the comment with `/*` and close it with `*/` on a different line.
